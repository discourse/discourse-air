# Tips

### Dark Light Scheme Toggle

![image|424x500, 50%](https://d11a6trkgmumsb.cloudfront.net/original/3X/1/e/1e498e5d1f26f6e46d09d48eabf7c7b6d291cd26.png)

For this to work properly, at least 2 color scheme choices need to be enabled in your `https://discourse.jordanvidrine.com/admin/customize/colors` area. At least two colors need to have `color scheme can be selected by users` enabled.

Once this is done, users should be able to choose between two color schemes as their `light` and `dark` preferences in their user preferences interface menu.

## Discourse Search Banner

In the options for the `discourse-search-banner` theme component, the `plugin-outlet` options needs to be set to **BELOW-SITE-HEADER** for this theme to render properly.

## Modern Category + Group Boxes

This theme component requires your categories to use the **CATEGORY BOXES WITH SUBCATEGORIES** setting in your `/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=categories` area.

![image|690x64, 75%](https://d11a6trkgmumsb.cloudfront.net/original/3X/c/2/c2798276e772741144c88c2ea47660b60bc3d4b5.png)

This theme component also allows the forum admin to organize their category page with header titles, and choose which categories appear under each header. To keep things simple, I have only allowed up to 5 headings to be used. **If no categories + heading settings are chosen, all categories will render as they do above, this is the default rendering option.**
